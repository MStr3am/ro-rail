#summary A step-by-step guide through the first-time install of RAIL.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

= Required Software =

RampageAI Lite relies on the use of Subversion (SVN) for distribution. To use SVN and download RAIL, you will first need to install [http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN]. The download page can be found at [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads].

You may also use other SVN clients; however, this guide will only give example screenshots using TortoiseSVN.

= Step-by-Step Install =

== Before You Begin: Locate your Ragnarok Online directory ==

Before continuing, you will need to locate the directory that Ragnarok Online is installed into. The following examples show _C:\Users\Robert\Documents\iRO\_ as the installation directory. Your install directory will probably be different.

The following steps will take place in the AI directory, which should be found inside the Ragnarok Online directory.

*Note:* Vista users should not install Ragnarok Online into the _Program Files_ directory, because of complications with User Account Controls (UAC).

== Step 1: Remove existing scripts ==

To avoid complications with existing custom AI files, it is recommended to remove any existing USER_AI directory. We will shortly add it back through TortoiseSVN.

== Step 2: Start TortoiseSVN checkout ==

Right click on an open area in your folder, and select "SVN Checkout". This will start the TortoiseSVN client program.

== Step 3: Identify the SVN repository ==

TortoiseSVN will ask for the location of the files to download. The URL of the repository is:
{{{
http://ro-rail.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
}}}

After you enter this, make sure that TortoiseSVN displays the _Checkout directory_ as *_xyz_\AI\USER_AI*, where _xyz_ is the location of your Ragnarok Online installation. In the example below, my installation is located at _C:\Users\Robert\Documents\iRO_. Yours will likely be different.

_Note: You may also browse the source of RampageAI Lite online at [http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail/source/browse/trunk]._

To ensure that Ragnarok Online is using RAIL as the AI script, please type `/hoai` (or `/merai` for mercenaries) until Ragnarok tells you that the script has been customized.
