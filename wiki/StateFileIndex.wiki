<wiki:toc />

= Introduction =

The Rampage AI Lite state-file contains all configuration relating to behavior of the AI. In addition, it also contains information regarding the current-state of the AI (for example, the ID number of the homunculus/mercenary).

The state-file options are verified as they are used, so it is impossible to cause a Lua error when changing options. Further, corrected values are saved back into the state-file.

Because of the way the state-file is saved, it is impractical to maintain user-comments or values outside of the rail_state table. The order of options may also change. Please avoid storing important information inside of the RAIL state file.

= Finding Your State-File =

By default, your state-file is located in the base Ragnarok Online directory. (See [http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail/wiki/FirstTimeInstall#Before_You_Begin:_Locate_your_Ragnarok_Online_directory Before You Begin: Locate your Ragnarok Online directory] for more information on finding your Ragnarok Online directory.) The [http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail/wiki/ConfigLuaFile#RAIL._StateFile RAIL.StateFile] option in the Config.lua file will specify the filename.

With default filename, the image below shows the state-file for a Rampage AI Lite-controlled mercenary. Notice that the default of `"RAIL_State.{2}.lua"` was automatically expanded to `"RAIL_State.merc.lua"` for the mercenary AI.

http://ro-rail.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/find-state-file.png

Once you've located the state-file, it is safe to open it in Microsoft Notepad or any other text-editor.

_Note: Vista users will have problems editing the state-file if it is inside the _Program Files_ directory. Please make sure your copy of Ragnarok Online is installed outside of this folder._

= An Important Note =

All options shown on this page will appear in the state-file similar to the following:
{{{
rail_state["Aggressive"] = false
}}}
In this example, the option is [StateFileIndex#Aggressive Aggressive], and the option is set to `false`.

The names of the options in the state-file (eg, "[StateFileIndex#Aggressive Aggressive]") are all case-sensitive. In other words, the option "aggRESsive" will not have any relation to the option "[StateFileIndex#Aggressive Aggressive]". When adding new options, be careful to note that the capitalization matches what is shown on this page.

= Options Index =

== Base Options Table ==

=== !AcquireWhileLocked ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

When set to `true`, !AcquireWhileLocked will cause the AI to actively seek targets that are outside of its attack range, even while attacking. Because this causes melee-range mercenaries/homunculi to run away from their attack target, it is recommended to enable only for long-range mercenaries.

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#AttackWhileChasing AttackWhileChasing]

=== !ActorOptions ===

_Please refer to [StateFileIndex#ActorOptions_Sub-table ActorOptions Sub-table]._

=== Aggressive ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

When set to `true`, Aggressive will cause the AI to actively search for new targets.

_Note: This option can be changed from inside the Ragnarok Online client by pressing `<ALT+T>` for a homunculus, or `<CTRL+T>` for a mercenary. Changes made by this key-press will be saved._

=== !AssistOptions ===

_Please refer to [StateFileIndex#AssistOptions_Sub-table AssistOptions Sub-table]._

=== ~~!AssistOther~~ ===

_This option was removed in [http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail/source/detail?r=164 revision 164]. Please refer to [StateFileIndex#AssistOptions_Sub-table AssistOptions Sub-table]._

<wiki:comment>
*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

!AssistOther operates like !AssistOwner, but causes the AI to assist its counterpart. For example, if both homunculus and mercenary are active, !AssistOther in the mercenary state-file would cause a passive mercenary to target enemies that the homunculus is attacking.

This option takes precedence over [StateFileIndex#Aggressive Aggressive] and [StateFileIndex#DefendOptions_Sub-table DefendOptions Sub-table] options.

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#AssistOwner AssistOwner]
</wiki:comment>

=== ~~!AssistOwner~~ ===

_This option was removed in [http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail/source/detail?r=164 revision 164]. Please refer to [StateFileIndex#AssistOptions_Sub-table AssistOptions Sub-table]._

<wiki:comment>
*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

When set to `true`, !AssistOwner will cause the AI to select targets that the owner is hostile against. This includes attacks, skill charge-up, and skill casts against enemy targets.

This option takes precedence over all others, including [StateFileIndex#Aggressive Aggressive], [StateFileIndex#AssistOther AssistOther], and [StateFileIndex#DefendOptions_Sub-table DefendOptions Sub-table] options.

</wiki:comment>

=== !AttackWhileChasing ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

_Not written yet. Check back soon!_

=== !DebugFile ===

*Type:* String

*Default:* `"RAIL_Log.{2}.lua"`

The !DebugFile option specifies where RAIL's logs should be output to. It allows pattern expansion in a similar manner as the [ConfigLuaFile#RAIL._StateFile Config.lua StateFile option]. Multiple instances of RAIL can simultaneously use the same log file without problem.

_Note: If the [ConfigLuaFile#RAIL.UseTraceAI Config.lua UseTraceAI option] is set to `true`, then this option will have no effect._

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#DebugLevel DebugLevel]; [StateFileIndex#ProfileMark ProfileMark]

=== !DebugLevel ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `50`

*Maximum Value:* `99`

This option sets the verbosity of RAIL logging, with higher numbers being more verbose. Unless troubleshooting or learning about RAIL, this option should be ignored.

_Note: Debug levels for various log messages can be found at the top of [http://ro-rail.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Debug.lua]._

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#DebugFile DebugFile]; [StateFileIndex#ProfileMark ProfileMark]

=== !DefendOptions ===

_Please refer to [StateFileIndex#DefendOptions_Sub-table DefendOptions Sub-table]._

=== !DisableChase ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

When !DisableChase is set to `true`, Rampage AI Lite will not attempt to move toward enemies. This setting removes offensive chase-targeting, and brings movement to a bare minimum. Take note that unlike restricting [StateFileIndex#MaxDistance MaxDistance], this still allows manually-controlled movement within the [StateFileIndex#MaxDistance MaxDistance] area.

_Note: Manually moving is possible on the homunculus with _`<ALT+Right Click>`_, and on the mercenary with _`<ALT+Left Click>`_._

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#MaxDistance MaxDistance]

=== !FollowDistance ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `4`

*Minimum Value:* `0`

*Maximum Value:* _The value of [StateFileIndex#MaxDistance MaxDistance]_

Once Rampage AI Lite begins following the owner (your character) due to [StateFileIndex#MaxDistance MaxDistance], it will only stop under two conditions:
  # Your character stops moving; or
  # Rampage AI Lite manages to get close enough to its owner.
!FollowDistance indicates how close RAIL needs to be before it decides it is "close enough" and resumes normal operation.

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#MaxDistance MaxDistance]

=== !IdleMovement ===

_Please refer to [StateFileIndex#IdleMovement_Sub-table IdleMovement Sub-table]._

=== !InterceptAlgorithm ===

*Type:* String

*Default:* `"normal"`

!InterceptAlgorithm specifies the method that RAIL should use to chase a moving target. There are four accepted values for this option:
  * `"none"` makes no future estimation, and moves toward the current location.
  * `"sloppy"` estimates where the target will be after 500ms, and moves toward that location.
  * `"normal"` makes a rough estimation where the target will be by the time the AI reaches it. This is recommended for regular use.
  * ~~`"advanced"`~~ _This option is not implemented yet._

_Note: This algorithm is also used when chasing after the owner to stay on screen._

=== !MaxDistance ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `13`

*Minimum Value:* `0`

*Maximum Value:* `14`

This option specifies the maximum distance (in tiles) that Rampage AI Lite should stray. RAIL will still move to attack enemies outside of this area, provided it has a long enough  attack range (eg, archer mercenaries).

If Rampage AI Lite detects that your character begins movement that will place it outside of this range, it will spend all resources in attempt to stay within this number of tiles.

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#FollowDistance FollowDistance]; [StateFileIndex#DisableChase DisableChase]

=== MobIDFile ===

*Type:* String

*Default:* `"./AI/USER_AI/Mob_ID.lua"`

MobIDFile specifies the file to communicate monster types with. It is recommended to leave this setting at default, except under special circumstances.

*Warning:* MobIDFile does _not_ support `{n}` pattern expansion. (For more information on pattern expansion, refer to the [ConfigLuaFile#RAIL._StateFile Config.lua StateFile option].)

_Note: The default setting is compatible with Azzy AI's Mob ID feature._

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#MobIDMode MobIDMode]

=== MobIDMode ===

*Type:* String

*Default:* `"automatic"`

MobIDMode is the main switch for Rampage AI Lite's Mob-ID communication support. When active, this feature allows Mercenary-type AIs to determine monster type with help from a Homunculus-type AI. The accepted values vary by the type of AI.

For AIs that are able to distinguish monster-type (eg, Homunculus):
  * `"disabled"` will not use Mob-ID communication. This will prevent Rampage AI Lite from creating or changing the file specified in [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile].
  * `"automatic"` will automatically enable use of Mob-ID communication when Rampage AI Lite is paired (eg, Homunculus and Mercenary are both active simultaneously). This is the recommended value for standard use.
  * `"overwrite"` will recreate the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile] each time Rampage AI Lite is loaded. Changing maps will clear all previous ID-to-type entries.
  * `"update"` will only update the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile] as new monsters (or changed-types) are found. Old values will remain unchanged. This is recommended only when generating a MobID file while teleporting within the same map.

For AIs that are _not_ able to distinguish monster-type (eg, Mercenary):
  * `"disabled"` never loads the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile]. Rampage AI Lite will be unable to distinguish monster types.
  * `"automatic"` will automatically enable use of Mob-ID communication when Rampage AI Lite is paired (eg, Homunculus and Mercenary are both active simultaneously). This is the recommended value for standard use.
  * `"once"` will only read the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile] when Rampage AI Lite starts. This provides compatibility for pre-generated tables (for example, generated by `"update"` or `"overwrite"` above).
  * `"active"` rereads the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile] whenever Rampage AI Lite encounters an actor that is not in the loaded Mob-ID table. This should not be used unless the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile] is being actively updated. (_Note: This mode is unable to detect monster-type changes._)

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobIDFile]

=== !ProfileMark ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `20000`

*Minimum Value:* `2000`

The !ProfileMark option specifies how often Rampage AI Lite should log profiling information. This information includes average cycle time, memory usage, etc. If you are unsure what this means, it is safe to ignore this option.

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#DebugFile DebugFile]; [StateFileIndex#DebugLevel DebugLevel]

=== !SkillOptions ===

_Please refer to [StateFileIndex#SkillOptions_Sub-table SkillOptions Sub-table]._

=== !TempFriendRange ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `-1`

*Minimum Value:* `-1`

!TempFriendRange sets the distance at which players will be temporarily considered "friends" for the purpose of defending, assisting, and disabling kill-steal protection. Players are considered friends only for the duration that they are within this range, and no permanent record is kept.

This range is counted by tiles from your character, from `0` to `5`. A value of `-1` indicates that no players should ever be counted as temporary friends.

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#AssistOptions_Sub-table AssistOptions Sub-table]; [StateFileIndex#DefendOptions_Sub-table DefendOptions Sub-table]

=== update ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

The update option is a hidden option that causes a running RAIL instance to reload its state-file configuration. To change state-file options without resetting the AI completely, set this option to `true`.

_Note: Because this is a hidden option, it will only appear in the state-file after being manually added. If you wish to enable it, please manually type it into the bottom of the state-file. Afterward, you may simply change `false` to `true`._

*Warning:* Please notice that the first letter is not capitalized. This option must be entered completely lowercase to take effect.

=== ~~UseMobID~~ ===

_This option was removed in [http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail/source/detail?r=158 revision 158]. Please refer to [StateFileIndex#MobIDMode MobIDMode]._

<wiki:comment>
*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

When UseMobID is set to `true`, Rampage AI Lite will begin to use the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobID File] to communicate monster types. 

For homunculi, this means that Rampage AI Lite will write a mapping of IDs into the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobID File]. This file will only be written when a new actor ID is encountered, or when an actor changes type ID.

For mercenaries, this means that Rampage AI Lite will load a table from the [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile MobID File] and use it to distinguish actor type IDs. When used properly, this enables mercenaries to distinguish different types of monsters, players, etc. This file is only loaded when a new actor ID is encountered.

*Warning:* This ID-mapping table is specific for each Ragnarok Online map (eg, moc_fild01) for each server (eg, iRO Ymir or iRO Valkyrie). An outdated MobID file, or one generated for a different Ragnarok map/server will cause unexpected behavior!

_Note: When both homunculus and mercenary are used together (with UseMobID enabled for both), the MobID file will always be proper and usable._

== !ActorOptions Sub-table ==

The !ActorOptions Sub-table contains what is sometimes referred to as "monster tactics". In order to determine the appropriate course of action, Rampage AI Lite separates options into three categories: `"Default"`, `"ByType"`, and `"ByID"`. Each category accepts identical options and can refer to both players and monsters. The categories are described in more detail below:

  * `"ByID"` is the most specific category, and differentiates actors by their specific ID in Ragnarok. At most, ByID will refer to only one actor at a time. Because character IDs remain the same across all maps, this option is most useful when defining options for a specific player.
  * `"ByType"` refers to actors by their type, which can be found in various online databases. For example, all non-rebirthed alchemists are of type `18` while a poring has type `1002`. It is important to remember that while many monsters may share the same name, they may have different types. A prominent example of this is with summoned mobs. As an example: [http://ro.amesani.org/db/monster-info/1120/ Ghostring] spawns with a different type of Giant Whisper than he later summons.
    * When using [http://ro.amesani.org/db/monster-info/ Amesani RO - Monster Info], the monster ID will appear in the URL. With the example of Abysmal Knight, `http://ro.amesani.org/db/monster-info/`*1219*`/` shows the type as `1219`.
    * _Note: Without help from a [StateFileIndex#MobIDFile Mob-ID File], Mercenaries are unable to distinguish monsters by type. Please refer to [StateFileIndex#MobIDMode MobIDMode] for information on creating and using Mob-ID files._
  * `"Default"` contains the base options, used as defaults for all actors.

When a specific option is not found under a `"ByID"` table, Rampage AI Lite will then check `"ByType"`. If the option is not found in `"ByType"`, then the `"Default"` option will used. In this way, `"ByID"` options override `"ByType"`, which override `"Default"`.

For example:
{{{
rail_state["ActorOptions"]["Default"] = {}
rail_state["ActorOptions"]["Default"]["Priority"] = 0
rail_state["ActorOptions"]["ByType"][123] = {}
rail_state["ActorOptions"]["ByType"][123]["Priority"] = 15
rail_state["ActorOptions"]["ByID"][1234] = {}
rail_state["ActorOptions"]["ByID"][1234]["Priority"] = 50
}}}
In this example, a monster with ID `1234` would have a [StateFileIndex#Priority Priority] value of 50, regardless of type. All monsters of type `123` would have a [StateFileIndex#Priority Priority] of 15. All _other_ monsters would have a [StateFileIndex#Priority Priority] of 0.

*Warning:* Note that the first line for any `"ByType"` or `"ByID"` value must set the ID/type to `{}`. *This is very important* because it is required for proper [http://www.lua.org/ Lua]-file interpretation. Failure to include this will prevent Rampage AI Lite from loading any state-file settings, and RAIL will subsequently generate a new state-file from scratch. Please see the [ActorOptionsExample ActorOptions Example State-file] for more examples.

=== !AttackAllowed ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `true`

!AttackAllowed specifies whether Rampage AI Lite should use physical attacks against a target. When both !AttackAllowed and [StateFileIndex#SkillsAllowed SkillsAllowed] are set to `false`, Rampage AI Lite will never target the specified monster or monsters.

_Note: When actor type can be distinguished (eg, on a homunculus), monsters of type `1555`, `1575`, `1579`, `1589`, and `1590` automatically use default setting of `false`. These are the 5 alchemist-summoned support monsters._

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#SkillsAllowed SkillsAllowed]

=== !DefaultIgnoreTicks ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `10000`

*Minimum Value:* `1000`

_Not written yet. Check back soon!_

=== !DefendOnly ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

This option indicates that an actor should only be considered a target if it is attacking any of the following:
  * The homunculus or mercenary that Rampage AI Lite is controlling,
  * The owner of this homunculus or mercenary,
  * The owner's other AI (if any),
    * For a homunculus, this is the owner's mercenary.
    * For a mercenary, this is the owner's homunculus.
  * Any player that is marked as a [StateFileIndex#Friend Friend] by the [StateFileIndex#ActorOptions_Sub-table ActorOptions Sub-table]'s `"ByID"`, `"ByType"`, or `"Default"` categories, or
  * Any player that is within a range specified by [StateFileIndex#TempFriendRange TempFriendRange].

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#AttackAllowed AttackAllowed]; [StateFileIndex#SkillsAllowed SkillsAllowed]

=== !FreeForAll ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

!FreeForAll indicates that specified target(s) should have kill-steal prevention code disabled. This is not recommended against non-MVP monsters, as players are often held accountable for their AI's behavior.

=== Friend ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `false`

The Friend option indicates that a player should be considered a friend. This option has no effect for monsters or other non-player actors.

_Note: It is not advised to set this for the `"Default"` category of [StateFileIndex#ActorOptions_Sub-table ActorOptions] because it will circumvent kill-steal prevention for all monsters._

=== !IgnoreAfterChaseFail ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `5000`

*Minimum Value:* `2000`

*Exceptional Values:* `-1` to disable

_Not written yet. Check back soon!_

=== !MaxCastsAgainst ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `-1`

*Minimum Value:* `-1`

!MaxCastsAgainst sets the maximum number of times that Rampage AI Lite should cast an attack skill (eg, Caprice or Pierce) against the specified target(s). A value of `-1` indicates "infinity"; in other words, `-1` means that there is no limit to the number of times it should cast against the target(s).

_Note: If the target dies or moves off-screen, Rampage AI Lite will reset its count of casts against that target. Under certain circumstances, this may result in more casts against one target than !MaxCastsAgainst allows._

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#MaxSkillLevel MaxSkillLevel]; [StateFileIndex#MinSkillLevel MinSkillLevel]; [StateFileIndex#SkillsAllowed SkillsAllowed]; [StateFileIndex#TicksBetweenSkills TicksBetweenSkills]

=== !MaxSkillLevel ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `5` for homunculi; `10` for mercenaries

*Minimum Value:* `1`

*Maximum Value:* `5` for homunculi; `10` for mercenaries

!MaxSkillLevel determines the maximum level of skill to be used against the specified target(s).

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#MaxCastsAgainst MaxCastsAgainst]; [StateFileIndex#MinSkillLevel MinSkillLevel]; [StateFileIndex#SkillsAllowed SkillsAllowed]; [StateFileIndex#TicksBetweenSkills TicksBetweenSkills]

=== !MinSkillLevel ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `1`

*Minimum Value:* `1`

*Maximum Value:* `5` for homunculi; `10` for mercenaries

!MinSkillLevel determines the minimum level of skill to be used against the specified target(s).

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#MaxCastsAgainst MaxCastsAgainst]; [StateFileIndex#MaxSkillLevel MaxSkillLevel]; [StateFileIndex#SkillsAllowed SkillsAllowed]; [StateFileIndex#TicksBetweenSkills TicksBetweenSkills]

=== Name ===

*Type:* String

*Default:* `"unknown"`

_Not written yet. Check back soon!_

=== Priority ===

*Type:* Number

*Default:* `0`

Priority specifies a numerical value assigned to each target. After evaluating each potential target, Rampage AI Lite selects the target with the highest value. If multiple targets share the same value, Rampage AI Lite will select the closest among them. This follows the idea that "highest number is highest priority" instead of the opposing idea that "number one is first priority".

_Note: Certain options (such as the [StateFileIndex#AssistOptions_Sub-table AssistOptions Sub-table] options) will reduce the list of potential targets before Rampage AI Lite evaluates each target's Priority value._

=== !SkillsAllowed ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `true`

!SkillsAllowed specifies whether Rampage AI Lite should use skills against a target. When both !SkillsAllowed and [StateFileIndex#AttackAllowed AttackAllowed] are set to `false`, Rampage AI Lite will never target the specified monster(s).

_Note: When actor type can be distinguished (eg, on a homunculus), monsters of type `1078`-`1085`, `1555`, `1575`, `1579`, `1589`, and `1590` automatically use default setting of `false`. These include the 5 alchemist-summoned support monsters and inactive plant monsters (eg, "Red Plant" or "Black Mushroom")._

== !AssistOptions Sub-table ==

The !AssistOptions Sub-table contains three settings related to the way Rampage AI Lite assists other players. Each settings is identical and works to classify the player into one of three groups:
  * `"Owner"` refers _only_ to Rampage AI Lite's owner; also known as your character.
  * `"Other"` refers _only_ to a paired homunculus or mercenary. For example, an alchemist's homunculus would refer to the same alchemist's mercenary as `"Other"`, and vice versa.
    * _Note: This only takes effect when both homunculus and mercenary are running Rampage AI Lite._
  * `"Friend"` refers to any player that is either:
    * explicitly marked as a [StateFileIndex#Friend Friend], or
    * is within a certain number of tiles from your character (decided by [StateFileIndex#TempFriendRange TempFriendRange]).

For clarity and simplicity, the following settings are described in terms of the above `"Owner"` category; however, each may be used for any category setting. The possible settings include: 
  * `"assist"` indicates that Rampage AI Lite should prioritize attacking your target. If multiple categories are set to `"assist"`, Rampage AI Lite will select targets in this order: `"Owner"`, `"Other"`, and `"Friend"`. In other words, the `"Owner"`'s target will take precedence over all others.
  * `"avoid"` causes Rampage AI Lite to attack your target _only_ when no other enemies are available. If multiple categories are set to `"avoid"`, Rampage AI Lite will group the targets together. In this way, it will avoid all `"avoid"`ed targets together, or none at all.
  * `"indifferent"` has no effect on the normal targeting routines of Rampage AI Lite. This option is default.

Both `"assist"` and `"avoid"` take precedence over the [StateFileIndex#ActorOptions_Sub-table ActorOptions Sub-table]'s [StateFileIndex#Priority Priority] option and all [StateFileIndex#DefendOptions_Sub-table DefendOptions Sub-table] options.

As an example, to optimize killing with a high-level pair of homunculus and mercenary:
Set the following in *both* `homu` and `merc` state-files:
{{{
rail_state["AssistOptions"]["Other"] = "avoid"
}}}

*Warning:* Setting *both* `homu` and `merc` state-file settings of `"Other"` to `"assist"` (as opposed to the above example of `"avoid"`) may result in low-priority targeting or other undesirable behavior.
