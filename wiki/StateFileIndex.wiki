= Introduction =

The Rampage AI Lite state-file contains all configuration relating to behavior of the AI. In addition, it also contains information regarding the current-state of the AI (for example, the ID number of the homunculus/mercenary).

The state-file options are verified as they are used, so it is impossible to cause a Lua error when changing options. Further

== Base Options Table ==

=== !ActorOptions ===

_Please refer to [StateFileIndex#ActorOptions_Sub-table ActorOptions Sub-table]._

=== Aggressive ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `False`

When set to `true`, Aggressive will cause the AI to actively search for new targets.

_Note: This option can be changed by pressing `<ALT+T>` for a homunculus, or `<CTRL+T>` for a mercenary. Changes made by this key-press will be saved._

=== !AssistOwner ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `False`

When set to `true`, !AssistOwner will cause the AI to select targets that the owner is hostile against. This includes attacks, skill charge-up, and skill casts against enemy targets.

This option takes precedence over all others, including [StateFileIndex#Aggressive Aggressive], [StateFileIndex#_AssistOther AssistOther], and [StateFileIndex#DefendOptions_Sub-table DefendOptions Sub-table] options.

*See also:* [StateFileIndex#_AssistOther AssistOther]

=== !AssistOther ===

*Type:* Boolean

*Default:* `False`

!AssistOther operates like !AssistOwner, but causes the AI to assist its counterpart. For example, if both homunculus and mercenary are active, !AssistOther in the mercenary state-file would cause a passive mercenary to target enemies that the homunculus is attacking.

This option takes precedence over [StateFileIndex#Aggressive Aggressive] and [StateFileIndex#DefendOptions_Sub-table DefendOptions Sub-table] options.
